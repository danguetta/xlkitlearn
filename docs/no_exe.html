        <h1>Installing on Windows Without the .exe File</h1>
        
        <p>Some students will not be able to install XLKitLearn using the .exe file. This is likely to be true if you have a corporate computer. If this is you, the installation instructions below <i>might</i> work for you.</p>
        
        <p>If the instructions below don't work for you, you migth be out of luck. But all is not lost - if you're at Columbia Business School, you can still hopefully take the class using one of the following strategies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use one of the computers around CBS, on which you will be able to install the add-in.</li>
            <li>Get a loaner PC from ITG for the duration of the course, if they have one available - email to ask them.</li>
            <li>Use a friend's computer, or an old computer, for the homeworks. You will <b>not</b> need the add-in for the final exam.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="divider div-transparent"></div>
        <br>
        
        Here are the alternative installation instructions; feel free to email us if you encounter any issues.
        
        <ol>
            <li>Go to any explorer window, and type <code>%LOCALAPPDATA%</code> into the address bar; press enter.
                <center><img src="img/local_app_data.jpg" width="60%"></center>
                For most people, this will take you to the <code>C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local</code> folder, where <code>USERNAME</code> is your username, but if it takes you elsewhere, that's fine!
            </li>
            <li>Inside this folder, create a NEW folder called <code>XLKitLearn</code>. For most people, this will mean you now have a folder called <code>C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\XLKitLearn</code>.
            <li>Download this <a href="https://github.com/danguetta/xlkitlearn/releases/latest/download/python-distro-x64.zip">zip file</a>. [Note: if you have a <i>very</i> old computer and you encounter issues, check out <a href="64_32_bit.html">this page</a>, and if you determine you have a 32-bit computer, download this <a href="https://github.com/danguetta/xlkitlearn/releases/latest/download/python-distro-x86.zip">alternative zip file</a>].</li>
            <li>Unzip this zip file directly into the folder you created in step 2. This might take a while.</li>
            <li>Download <a href="https://github.com/danguetta/xlkitlearn/releases/latest/download/XLKitLearn.xltm">this xltm file</a>. You should put this somewhere safe like your desktop - every time you want to run the add-in, you'll need to double click on this Excel template file.</li>
            <li>You're done! Go back to the <a href="index.html#windows_install_part_2">second part</a> of the Windows installation instructions on the main install page. Instead of finding "XLKitLearn" in the start menu when you want to run the add-in, you'll be opening the <code>xltm</code> file you downloaded in the previous step.</li>
        </ol>
        
        If you ever want to uninstall the add-in, you can safely delete the XLKitLearn folder you created above - that's it!
